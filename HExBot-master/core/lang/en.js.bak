There are some time counting limitations when tab is inactive in most browsers. So, the bot may get slow if it\'s run into a inactive tab.\n\n* Use the notifiers carefully. The suspect logs notifier sends a GET request every second uninterruptedly. The new missions notifier sends a GET request every two seconds just when seconds to next missions are <= 1. Otherwise, it just waits. Big amounts of requests may be noticed by the game server. \'X-Requested-With\' header is not sent. :)\n\n* Abort the bot anytime. Just click over red bot button. \n\n* If bot suddendly stops, just try to reload the page. If it doesn\'t work, abort the bot. If you know how to access browser console, copy the error and/or jSpaghetti debug logs and report the problem on official repository.',
